# Parrot Lipsync

This is an addon for Blender that lets you automically generate lipsync data from audio tracks.  It uses the Whisper AI library to turn audio into words, and then Espeak to turn words into phonemes.


## Installation

You will need to have eSpeak installed on your system for Parrot Lipsync to work.  You can download it form its website:
